# Fridge Friend

Welcome From Team 2021 A Ticket Odyssey

Fridge Friend was created to help everyone who eats. We live in a world of waste and a drive for financial efficiency, FridgeFriend exists to help solve that problem and make life easier by showing items currently in your fridge, suggestions for meal ideas, and notifications to let users know which items are about to expire.


Updates and current features are all tracked in Trello https://trello.com/b/TMqowQKs/fridge-friend. For the most up to date code check out our progress on the dev branch here - https://github.com/Savannahj17/FridgeFriend/tree/dev
